# Music-Player
This project entitled ‘Music Player’ aims at developing a website for accessing and playing songs over the internet. Owing to the growing usage of seamless access to entertainment, there must be appropriate improvements in performance and stability of applications. Time and Space constraints need to be resolved for storing and playing songs seamlessly over the internet. Usage of appropriate data structures can make Music players more efficient and reliable. Due to the popularity and collection of songs in Spotify®, this project makes use of its API to access over thousands of songs.
