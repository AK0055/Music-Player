# Music-Player
This project entitled ‘Music Player’ aims at developing a website for accessing and playing songs over the internet. Owing to the growing usage of seamless access to entertainment, there must be appropriate improvements in performance and stability of applications. Time and Space constraints need to be resolved for storing and playing songs seamlessly over the internet. Usage of appropriate data structures can make Music players more efficient and reliable. Due to the popularity and collection of songs in Spotify®, this project makes use of its API to access over thousands of songs.
## Method
The top tracks and top artists of the user are retrieved using the Spotify API
 Using the top tracks and top artist, a random artist and track seed is selected
 Using the seed, 50 tracks are obtained
 A Score function is used to find the score of the track
 A custom comparator class is used for priority queue which ranks the tracks based on the
score
 The Doubly Linked list is used to store the tracks and retrieve them when ranking it
The users will be first prompted to login to Spotify. Once they have successfully logged in, A
series of actions will be used to communicate with the server for requesting and fetching
resources required for the users to access data. Spotify uses authentication tokens for such actions
and they require to be programmed by the developers according their needs. The HTTP actions
such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE are used appropriately when required.

## Data structures used
-Double linked list is used to store and traverse music in the way of previous, current and next
song or in the reverse way. Each song is accessed using their unique song IDs generated by the
API. It has O(1) time complexity and it is decent enough to handle access times. The space
complexity is O(N) where N is the number of songs in the playlist. Circular linked list is not used
owing to the possibility of infinite loops and glitches in the traversal. However, with the
availability of smooth and easy UI going back to the first track in the playlist is made easier.
-Priority Queue is used to rank the songs according to certain criteria used by Spotify API like:
Time signature, Acousticness, Danceability, Energy, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Loudness,
Speechiness, Valence and Tempo.
The time complexities for peeking, inserting and deleting data are O(1), O(log n) and O(log n)
respectively. This is implemented as a binary heap and hence it has much optimised access time.
